This is my configuration for Emacs written in literate Elisp with
`org`. Tested in Emacs 28.2. The package dependencies should be
obvious from `package-selected-packages` in `custom.el` where custom
variables are stored. Use `package-install-selected-packages` to
install them. Packages not found in the MELPA are put under *local
packages* in the config file. Feel free to delete that subtree.
