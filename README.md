# dotemacs

This is my configuration for Emacs written in literate Elisp with
`org`. I found it to be working with Emacs 25.1.1. The package
dependencies should be obvious from `package-selected-packages` in
`custom.el` where custom variables are stored. If a package I use i
not found in the MELPA I put it under *local packages* in the config
file. Feel free do delete that subtree.

*I use cua-mode, don't hate*
